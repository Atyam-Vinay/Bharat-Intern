# Bharat-Intern
for data science projects at bharat intern 
This repositry consists of two deep learning models created for the bharat intern virtual internship
#1.Stock data prediction using LSTM neural networks:
I creted deep learning model to predict the stockprice of Apple stock
#2.Hand written digit recognition using neural networks:
I created deep learning model to recognise hand written digits
I used the mnist data set to train the model
